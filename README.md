[Frankfurter](https://frankfurter.dev) is a free and open-source currency data API that tracks reference exchange rates published by the European Central Bank.

`api.frankfurter.app` hosts a public instance of the API.

## Getting Started

```

Get rates for a period.

```http
https://api.frankfurter.app/2010-01-01..2010-01-31
```

## Deployment

You can self-host Frankfurter with Docker.

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 \
  -e "DATABASE_URL=<postgres_url>" \
  --name frankfurter hakanensari/frankfurter
```

Alternatively, copy the [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) file to your system, and in the same directory run:

```bash
docker compose up --wait 
```

This will also setup and host the PostgreSQL for Frankfurter.
